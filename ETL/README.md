# Data Engineering Lab: Extract, Transform, and Load Data using Python

## Introduction

Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations are crucial for Data Engineers to efficiently manage and process data. In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in performing these operations using Python. The primary tasks include reading data from CSV, JSON, and XML files, extracting necessary information, transforming the data to meet specific requirements, and finally saving it in a format ready for loading into a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Read CSV, JSON, and XML file types using Python.
2. Extract the required data from different file types.
3. Transform the extracted data into the desired format.
4. Save the transformed data in a format suitable for loading into an RDBMS.


### 1. Download the Data

Download the zip file containing the required data in multiple formats.

```bash -- If wget is not installed then install using brew install wget

wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0221EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%206/Lab%20-%20Extract%20Transform%20Load/data/source.zip
unzip source.zip


# Conclusion

In this lab, you practiced the implementation of:

1. Extraction of data from CSV, JSON, and XML file formats.

2. Transformation of data as per requirement.

3. Loading the transformed data to a CSV file.

4. Logging the progress of the said operations.
